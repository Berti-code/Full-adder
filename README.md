# Full-adder
<p>The 4 bit full adder is composed of 4 full adders, full adders cand be connected by connecting the carry out wire of the
first one to the carry in wire of the second one, and so on.</p>
<p>After connecting all of the 4 adders, the carry out wire of the last one will be connected to nothing, it represents
the overflow,but it can be connected to an LED and it can be interpreted as the most significant bit of the representation.</p>
<p>The other digits of the number will be the results of the partial sums of each full adder.</p>
<p>In one of the images there is a diagram of a 4bit full adder, and the other one is taken while I started working on this project.</p>
